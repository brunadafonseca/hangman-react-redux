# Hangman Game

This is a simple game that we built to apply what we learned in our first week of React and Redux.

### Project requirements:

+ Don't use a database, just a frontend using React/Redux
+ Only use 1 action in your Redux setup

```bash
g clone git@github.com:brunadafonseca/hangman-react-redux.git
cd hangman-react-redux
yarn install
yarn start
```
